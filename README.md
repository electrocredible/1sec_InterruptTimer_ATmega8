# 1sec_InterruptTimer_ATmega8

This code will work on AVR 8-bit microcontrollers. It was written for AtMega8 using Atmel Studio 7.0 software on Windows 8.1.
It uses TIMER1 and increments a variable when the timer overflows. The timer overflows every 1 second.
Change F_CPU values as required depending on your oscillator frequency.
